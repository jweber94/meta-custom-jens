# Jens' custom yocto layer for the STM32MP1157D-DK1
+ This is my first custom yocto layer that is build upon the tutorial that you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTEdfwtPtNY&list=PLEBQazB0HUyTpoJoZecRK6PpDG31Y7RPB&index=6

## Adding a password to root
+ In contrast to the youtube tutorial, the `-P` of yocto's usermod does not exist anymore, you can see this on [this](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/migration-guides/migration-3.4.html) page
	- As an example for _how to add a password to the root user_,  you can have a look at https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/variables.html#term-EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS
	- It is ***VERY*** important to have the [escaped](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5105143/list-of-all-characters-that-should-be-escaped-before-put-in-to-regex) password placed in single quotes (') to have yocto recognize it correctly! (You will NOT get an error by bitbake if you do not use them, but you can not login to your device!)
+ The password can be generated by the terminal, using the following command:
	- `printf "%q" $(mkpasswd -m sha256crypt tester01)`
	- Here, _tester01_ must be replaced by you demanded password! The outcome of this command is an _already escaped_ password!

## Repository structure
+ The `recipes-example` folder is autogenerated by `bitbake-layers create-layer meta-custom-jens` and stays within the repo just as a reference. It could be deleted without having an impact on the resulting images
